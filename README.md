# Physics Forge

**Physics Forge** is a modern, interactive platform designed for students to **learn physics concepts faster and smarter**. It combines **3D visualizations**, **formula simulations**, **study tracking**, and **exam reminders** into a single web application. The project is built with **React** for the frontend and **Django** for backend APIs, creating a seamless **SPA experience** with dynamic content.

## üèÜ Features

### Core Features
- **Interactive 3D Visualizations:** Render formulas and physics concepts in 3D for better understanding.
- **Custom Simulations:** Input formulas and observe results dynamically in 2D/3D or theory mode.
- **Organized Learning:** Track subjects, notes, and references in one centralized platform.
- **Smart Reminders:** Receive notifications for exams, deadlines, and study schedules using AI reminders.
- **Progress Tracking:** Charts and analytics to measure your growth and performance over time.

### Authentication & User Management
